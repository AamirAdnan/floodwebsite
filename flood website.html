        <center><p>Floods can happen on flat or low-lying areas when water is supplied by rainfall or snowmelt more rapidly  than it can either infiltrate or run off. <br> The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated,  which effectively stops infiltration,<br> where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense rain from one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible <br> through frozen ground, rock, concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions <br> not  connected to a stream channel,  because the velocity of overland flow depends on the surface slope. <br> Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation. <br>  A flood is an overflow  of water that submerges land that is usually dry. Floods can be caused by natural phenomena such as heavy rainfall, snowmelt, <br> coastal storms, or human-made causes such as deforestation, urbanization, or climate change.</p></center>

<center><p>A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. In the sense of "flowing water", <br> the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology <br> and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, <br> changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. In particular climate change's  <br> increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk.</p></center>

          <li>Stay informed about weather conditions and flood warnings.</li>

          <hr><li>Turn off electricity and gas if instructed to do so.</li>
          <hr><li>Avoid driving or walking through floodwaters.</li>
          <hr><li>Be aware of flash flood areas such as canals, streams, drainage channels.</li>
